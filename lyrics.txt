No Air
Jordin Sparks

[Intro: Jordin Sparks]
Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air (Air, air)
Ooh, oh, no

[Verse 1: Jordin Sparks, Chris Brown]
If I should die before I wake
It's 'cause you took my breath away
Losing you is like living in a world with no air, oh
I'm here alone, didn't wanna leave
My heart won't move, it's incomplete
Wish there was a way that I can make you understand



[Pre-Chorus: Jordin Sparks]
But how (How) do you expect me (Me)
To live alone with just me? (Me)
'Cause my world revolves around you
It's so hard for me to breathe

[Chorus: Jordin Sparks & Chris Brown]
Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air (No air)
Can't live, can't breathe with no air
That's how I feel whenever you ain't there
It's no air, no air
Got me out here in the water so deep
Tell me how you're gon' be without me (Me)
If you ain't here, I just can't breathe
It's no air, no air

[Post-Chorus: Jordin Sparks, Chris Brown]
No air, air (Oh-oh)
No air, air (No, ooh)
No air, air (Oh, ah)
No air, air

[Verse 2: Chris Brown, Jordin Sparks]
I walked, I ran, I jumped, I flew
Right off the ground to float to you
There's no gravity to hold me down for real
But somehow I'm still alive inside
You took my breath, but I survived
I don't know how, but I don't even care

[Pre-Chorus: Jordin Sparks & Chris Brown]
So how (How) do you expect me (Me)
To live alone with just me? (Oh, oh)
'Cause my world revolves around you
It's so hard for me to breathe

[Chorus: Jordin Sparks, Chris Brown, Both]
Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air (Oh) (Oh)
Can't live, can't breathe with no air (Oh) (Oh)
That's how I feel whenever you ain't there
It's no air, no air
Got me out here in the water, so deep (So deep)
Tell me how you're gon' be without me (Without me, yeah)
If you ain't here, I just can't breathe (Breathe, no)
It's no air, no air (No air)

[Post-Chorus: Jordin Sparks, Both]
No air, air (Oh)
No air, air (Oh, no)
No air, air (No, whoa)
No air, air (No more)

[Bridge: Jordin Sparks, Chris Brown, Both]
(No air)
Ooh, baby, oh
It's no air, no air
Hey! Ooh, no air, oh
(No air)
Oh oh!

[Chorus: Jordin Sparks, Chris Brown, Both]
Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air (No air)
Can't live, can't breathe with no air (Oh whoa) (No air)
That's how I feel whenever you ain't there (No breathing) (No breathing at all)
It's no air, no air
Got me out here in the water, so deep (So deep) (So deep)
Tell me how you're gon' be without me (Without me, yeah) (Can't live without you, baby)
If you ain't here, I just can't breathe (Breathe)
It's no air, no air (No air)

[Hook / Pre-Chorus: Jordin Sparks, Chris Brown]
No air, air
(How do you expect me?)
No air, air (Baby, bae)
(To live alone with just me)
No air, air (Oh!)
('Cause my world revolves around you) (Oh whoa whoa)
No air, air
(It's so hard for me to breathe) (Hard for me to breathe) (Oh!)

[Chorus: Jordin Sparks, Chris Brown, Both]
Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air (No air)
Can't live, can't breathe with no air (Hard for me to breathe) (No, no, no)
That's how I feel whenever you ain't there (Oh!) (Not there)
It's no air, no air
Got me out here in the water, so deep
Tell me how you're gon' be without me
If you ain't here, I just can't breathe
It's no air, no air

[Hook: Jordin Sparks, Chris Brown, Both]
No air, air (Oh)
No air, air (Oh oh) (Whoa)
No air, air (No air)
No air

Treat You Better
Shawn Mendes

I won't lie to you
I know he's just not right for you
And you can tell me if I'm off
But I see it on your face
When you say that he's the one that you want
And you're spending all your time
In this wrong situation
And anytime you want it to stop

I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman

Tell me, why are we wasting time
On all your wasted crying
When you should be with me instead?
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can

I'll stop time for you
The second you say you'd like me too

I just wanna give you the loving that you're missing
Baby, just to wake up with you
Would be everything I need, and this could be so different
Tell me what you want to do

'Cause I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me, why are we wasting time
On all your wasted crying
When you should be with me instead?
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can

Better than he can

Give me a sign
Take my hand, we'll be fine
Promise I won't let you down
Just know that you don't
Have to do this alone
Promise I'll never let you down

'Cause I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me, why are we wasting time
On all your wasted crying
When you should be with me instead?
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can, oh
Better than he can
Better than he can
